# How to run Civilization II on macOS in 2025

![CIV2 macOS gameplay](images/civ2.png)

Civilization II was released in 1996 for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, making use of the WinG graphics library. The Multiplayer Gold Edition from 1998 is a true native Win32 application without this dependency so it can reliably run using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), and it can make use of larger modern screen resolutions.

The objectives for this guide are:
- To run Civilization II Multiplayer Gold Edition
- Bug fixes and quality of life enhancements
- In-game music playback
- Videos for the High Council and for Wonders of the World
- All bundled game scenarios

## Game Installation
As with my [guide for SimCity 2000](https://github.com/patters-match/SC2KmacOS), we shall use [Porting Kit](https://www.portingkit.com/download). This offers an existing configuration for Civilization II, though its description does not make clear that this is in fact the Multiplayer Gold Edition. It mentions that it's a DOS game - also inaccurate since it targeted Windows 95.

This 'port' uses engine `WS11WineCX21.2.0` and will automatically download the game from the [bestoldgames.net](https://www.bestoldgames.net/) abandonware site. I'm not sure how it achieves this, since my own manual install experiments were confounded by the game's installer being a 16-bit executable, and not one that can be swapped out easily for a 32-bit version as with SimCity 2000.

This Porting Kit installation provides a working base game, however the in-game music, the videos, and the additional scenarios are all missing.

## Fixes and Enhancements
[Civilization 2 UI Additions](https://github.com/FoxAhead/Civ2-UI-Additions) is one-stop-shop of patches, fixes, and usability enhancements.
- In Porting Kit, navigate to Games > Installed.
- Hover over Custom Port named Civilization II, click on the gear wheel, Show in Finder.
- Right-click, Show package contents.
- Copy the Civ2UIA launcher and dll to `Contents/drive_c/Civilization 2`.
- Navigate back up to `Contents` and double-click `Wineskin`.
- Click Advanced, then amend 'Windows app' to the following, including the quotes:  
  `"C:\Civilization 2\Civ2UIALauncher.exe" -play -exe "C:\Civilization 2\civ2.exe" -dll "C:\Civilization 2\Civ2UIA.dll"`

## In-Game Music
The original game would play the in-game music tracks from the CD-ROM drive. The UI Additions hack allows music playback from files instead. The audio tracks can be extracted from a bin/cue image of the original disk:
- Use [Homebrew package manager](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/bchunk) to install bchunk: `brew install bchunk`
- `bchunk -w ~/Downloads/Sid_Meier_s_Civilization_II_Multiplayer.bin ~/Downloads/Sid_Meier_s_Civilization_II_Multiplayer.cue track`
- This will result in `track01.iso` the CD-ROM data track, for the files, and WAV files `track02` to `track12` extracted with the required names.
- In Porting Kit, navigate to Games > Installed.
- Hover over Custom Port named Civilization II, click on the gear wheel, Show in Finder.
- Right-click, Show package contents.
- Create the folder `Contents/drive_c/Civilization 2/MUSIC`
- Copy the audio tracks into that folder.

## Videos
The next challenge is that the videos were not included in the bestoldgames.net download, and they are encoded using a very old Indeo 4 video codec. It should be trivial to add this codec via a winetrick script, but unfortunately this is outdated in the chosen engine and does not work.
- Right click on the track01.iso you created in the previous section, and select Open with > DiskImageMounter.
- From that mounted volume, open the Civ2 folder.
- Copy the `KINGS` and `VIDEOS` folders into the ported app's `Contents/drive_c/Civilization 2` folder.
- Eject the ISO image. It will prevent the in-game audio from working if it is mounted.
- Download Intel Indeo 5 Video codec [here](https://download.civforum.de/civ2/iv5setup.exe). There are various other installers for this on the Web, but many seem to have 16-bit setup loaders which will not work here, so use this one.
- Once again launch `Contents/Wineskin`.
- Click Install Software.
- Browse to `ivsetup.exe`.
- Select a Custom Install.
- Deselect all components except `Indeo Video 4 Codec`, noting that you will need to scroll down the list of components to do this. If you do not do this, the installer will get stuck searching for Netscape browser installations to add plugins to:  
  ![Indeo codec installer](images/indeo.png)
- When the installation completes a Windows Explorer window titled Indeo will open. Close this manually to complete the process.
- Wineskin will warn that no new executables were detected. Ignore this.
- Cancel back to the main Wineskin screen.
- Click Tools > Command Line (cmd):  
  `reg import "C:\Civilization 2\Vfwfix.reg"`
- Close the cmd window.
- If you launch the app now you will see the intro video, confirming working playback.
- Start a new game then click the Game menu > Graphic Options > enable High Council and Wonder Movies.

## Scenarios
The bestoldgames.net download which Porting Kit uses does not include the two expansions of game scenarios bundled with Multiplayer Gold Edition. We cannot run the installer since it's a 16-bit executable, however we can extract them from the CD-ROM data:
- Mount track01.iso once again.
- Install unshield via Homebrew: `brew install unshield`
- ```
  cd ~/Downloads
  mkdir MGE
  cd MGE
  unshield x /Volumes/Civ2\:MGE\ v1.0/data1.cab
  ```
- From `~/Downloads/MGE/Scenarios_-_English` copy the `SCENARIOS` folder to the app's `Contents/drive_c/Civilization 2` folder.
- As explained in `Contents/drive_c/Civilization 2/CIV2FANW.TXT` - do not move scenario files from their folder structure.
- Eject the mounted ISO image.

Enjoy! üèõÔ∏è
